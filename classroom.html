     <p>The classroom is brightly lit with sunlight from the windows and lamps. Most of the furniture and walls are in different shades of brown, with dark blue and bright green accents. As you walk in you see a shelf with a clipboard and pen on it. This is the sign-out sheet for students taking breaks or going to the nurse or office. Next to it is a handful of hall passes.
     </p>
     <p>Further into the classroom are lab tables arranged in a circle, with space between them to walk. Chairs are arranged around the outside of the circle, with a couple of extra chairs on the inside of the circle near the front of the classroom. That front is marked by a projector screen. When not in use for instruction, the screen displays a trailcam livestream: ospreys nesting and raising chicks, or bears hunting for salmon, or sharks swimming in a public aquarium. Around the screen is a whiteboard. One side holds the week’s agenda, and the other side is used for instruction. Around the top and sides of the whiteboard run the vining leaves of a pothos plant.
     </p>
     <p>In the middle of the circle of tables is another, low table. It has some pillows set around it for sitting, and holds a handout that students are expected to pick up as they enter the room. There is a crank on the side of the table that can be used to raise it up to a more normal height.
    </p>
    <p>Around the room are a few signs. Each period has a poster of the class expectations they decided on, with amendments taped to the bottom. There are signs demonstrating different levels of content mastery, from “I have no idea” at level 1 through “I could teach this to someone else” at level 5.
     </p>
     <p>Opposite the projector screen, on the back wall, is a row of windows set above a long lab bench. On the bench are a couple of plants, an aquarium, and ongoing student experiments. Shelves below the bench hold more experiments, and drawers hold commonly needed glassware and other materials.
     </p>
     <p>On the last side of the room, opposite the door, is a reading nook, the quiet corner. Bookshelves set a couple of comfy armchairs from the rest of the room. On a shelf next to these chairs are a number of self-care tools: some fidget toys, CBT worksheets, art supplies, etc. On the back of each chair drapes a weighted blanket. This corner takes up half of that forth wall.
    </p>
    <p>On the remaining part of that forth wall is the supply station. A shelf against the back of one of the chairs holds general supplies: a large cup of pencils, another of pens, stacks of lined and unlined paper, and clipboards. Against the wall itself is a locking supply cabinet with more delicate materials, like microscopes. Finally there is a supply sink. On the counter next to it is a tea kettle, and on the shelf above are mugs, a few teas, and a “dirty dishes” bin. The floor in front of these supply areas is empty, for ease of access; but students might also bring chairs here for another area to work.
     </p>
     <p>As you turn back to look at the entrance to the classroom, you see that wall is also a whiteboard. This whiteboard is covered with student notes (and doodles) from the last class. Above it is a sign that says “Process, Plan, Discuss.” Below the whiteboard is a long, low shelving unit. It holds turn-in baskets for each period and space for students to store their lab journals and other projects.
     </p>
     <p>In the hallway outside the classroom is an LCD screen. This screen displays the live feed of the classroom webcam, which is focused on one of our long-term projects, such as caterpillers going through their life stages.
    </p>
<h3>Uses</h3>
<img class="rtfloat" src="AnchorChartUnderstanding.png" />
     <p>The classroom as described is set up to focus on class discussions, with everybody facing each other. The tables closest to the projector screen have some extra chairs, so the students can easily move to face the screen for instruction.
     </p>
     <p>The low center table and the quiet corner provide flexible seating arrangements. In addition, students can take a clipboard and their chair to work anywhere in the classroom or in the hallway during independent work. Having most of the chairs on the outside of the main circle also makes it easy to move tables closer together for group work.
     </p>
     <p>The visuals in the room are mostly student created. On the first day of class each period will come up with expectations for each other and for me. These will be formalized onto a poster for easy reference. 
     </p>
     <p>On one side of one of the whiteboards is an agenda, organized by class subject and day of the week. Here students can easily see what we will be doing that week, what assignments are due when, and when events like assemblies happen.

<h3>Adaptation:</h3> <p>This design is idealized in many ways, and may have to be adapted to fit classroom size, number of students, and available equipment. Here are some ways I anticipate adapting this design:
</p>
<p>Big circle of desks: Many classrooms won’t have room for a circle that will fit all students and still have room to easily access both the front board and the lab bench. The circle may be turned into a broken-sided rectangle to fit some classrooms, which will also work well for small group work. If there still isn’t enough room, the tables may be arranged in the “butterfly” shape , which allows for easy discussion even without the sense of inclusion that a circle gives. If space is still tight, tables will be arranged in small groups – we can always push the tables back and pull the chairs into a circle for easier class discussions.
</p>
<p>Windows: If I have a class without windows, I will add more lamps, sparing use of florescent overheads, and grow lights for experiments.
</p>
<p>Technology: In a lower-budget classroom we may not have a projector screen or the class livestream. The layout of whiteboards, supply area, and quiet corner, as well as the positioning of posters, will depend on the classroom.
</p>
<p>Plants and animals: What types we have in class will depend in part on student’s allergies, which I will ask about in a student information sheet at the beginning of the year. There may not be plants if a student has a strong fungal/mold allergy, for instance.
</p>
<h3>CRT Response Questions:</h3>
<p>Q: How are the students’ lives, cultures, and experiences reflected in the environment, curriculum, and instruction?
</p>
<p>A: Students will have the opportunity to choose many projects based on their interests. We will explicitly address different cultural expectations while setting expectations for the classroom (ie, how do you show you are listening if you aren’t comfortable with eye contact?). After the school year has gone on a bit, students will have the chance to review the classroom environment including what is/isn’t working for them. Students will also influence organisms in the class, such as whether we should raise caterpillars or tadpoles or something else.
</p>
<p>Q: How do you create a welcoming classroom for all students?
</p>
<p>A: It is impossible to guarantee that everyone will feel welcome; people are too different. But I will attempt to have a culture of respect where everyone is comfortable being vulnerable, and to keep lines of communication open. As I get to know my students, we can work on changing any issues they have with the classroom. To start with, there will be different types of seating that students can choose to feel comfortable; student voice in class expectations; and a discussion of how to be respectful towards each other. I will also have ways for students to bring up issues with me without having to talk to me directly (a comment box and a card they can bring to another teacher to ask them to talk to me on the student’s behalf).
</p>
<p>Q: Look at your classroom walls. Ask yourself whether all of your students can find relatable visuals and props from a diverse range of fields and backgrounds. How could/would you do this in your classroom?
</p>
<p>A: I don’t expect to have that much wall space; I would rather use most of what I have on writable space for students to use rather than random posters. That way they have both more ownership of the space and a way to control what is up on the walls.
</p>
<p>Q: How can you involve students in the design and set up of your class?
</p>
<p>A: Students will create posters featuring the class expectations that their period decided on, to go up on the walls. I will occasionally give students a chance to reflect on what is and isn’t working for them in the classroom, and we will discuss how to change things. Students are also welcome to move chairs/tables to places that are comfortable for them to work, as long as they are put back for the next class during cleanup time.
</p>
<p>Q: How can you include different kinds of diversity in your classroom materials. Think about ethnicity, language, ability, gender identity, and socioeconomic experiences. Watch out for materials that perpetuate stereotypes or insulting depictions of diverse communities.
</p>     
     <p>A: There will be a supply station with lots of pencils, paper, and other supplies available for students. I will present this as available for any students who don’t have their supplies that day; but the main intent is to supply those students who may not otherwise be able to afford class materials. Similarly, when I require materials, such as a lab notebook, I will have a few extras on hand “in case some of you don’t have a chance to go get one.”
</p>    
    <p>My library will include science dictionaries in different languages, which I will add to as I get ESL students who can use them.
</p>     
     <p>I will include instructional materials that feature scientists from different cultures and ethnicities, as well as disabled scientists. I want all of the students to know that people who look/act/talk like them can be scientists. I will include subtitles on all videos in the language of ESL students (I’m not yet sure how to handle having students who need support in multiple non-english languages)
     </p>
