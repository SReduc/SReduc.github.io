<h3>Expectations for Behavior</h3>
<p>My priorities as a teacher are to keep my students safe, to help you meet state standards, and to leave you with an interest in my subject. In that order. Outside of that, I'm not big on compliance for the sake of compliance.
So when it comes to behaviors in the classroom, I don't want to put together a set of rules for you to follow about when you can eat or use the restroom. But, we have to have some expectations for each other so that we can work together and so that I can meet my goals. These expectations are things I want to decide on together, as a class.<br />
I will help guide that discussion so that we cover important senarios and safety; but the way we decide to interact will be your decision, in your words. Making up those expectations will be your first challenge in working together, because in the end we have to have guidelines that <i>everyone</i> in the class is comfortable putting their names to. We will write the expectations on a poster to hang up in class, and will ammend them when you or I feel that something isn't working.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some of the topics and situations we will discuss when coming up with expectations:
  <ul>
    <li>What do you need to feel respected?</li>
    <li>How do you want to show others respect? Consider your classmates, your teachers, the other students that use our classes, and the custodians who keep these spaces in working order</li>
    <li>How can we respect and communicate boundaries?</li>
    <li>When should everyone be included, and when is it ok for only some people to participate?</li>
    <li>How can we make sure we are including everyone? Think about small group work, whole-class discussions, and how to make decisions as a class.</li>
    <li>How will we listen when someone is talking?</li>
    <li>What do we need to do to be careful with lab equipment?</li>
    <li>What will our clean-up routine be?</li>
    <li>Should we raise hands to talk?</li>
    <li>How should Sarah get the classes' attention for instruction or changing activities? (please note that I have a cow bell!)</li>
    <li>What can we do to be aware of our emotions and when our emotions are affecting our behaviors?</li>
    <li>What can we do when someone is upset? How can we handle being upset? (We will have a "comfy calm corner" as one option, but we should come up with more!)</li>
    <li>How can you comfortably give Sarah feedback?</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Implementing Expectations</h4>
<p>Here's what this discussion and the use of our expectations will actually look like.<br />
Before we start the discussion I will ask everybody to spend a few minutes thinking about previous classes you have been in and what behaviors worked well or poorly for you. I'm not interested in what others have said you should do; I want to know what <i>you</i> found useful. What sort of environment helps you learn? What do you need to feel respected? How can you show respect? You can think through this quietly or discuss it with your neighbors. Make sure to take some notes so you remember everything for the discussion.
</p>
<p> With this first discussion I am going to be careful to guide it and make sure everyone gets a chance to speak (for later discussions you will have your own protocols for this!). I will bring up specific situations we need to talk about, and ask questions to encourage you to be specific and to give examples of your ideas. But this isn't about you talking to me; this is about you talking with each other, as a whole class. I'm going to play moderator and take notes on the board. Once we have a set of expectations we will take a break. This is to give everyone time to think without having to listen. I'll ask you to write down issues you see with the expectations and refinements you think we need to make. We will discuss those issues and decide on final expectations. This isn't a simple vote; these expectations need to be things that everyone is comfortable following, and so I expect everyone to put work in to find things we can all agree to. Once we have our final expectations, we will hang them up on a poster for everyone to see.
</p><p>
But, these won't really be "final" expectations. We will continue to test and refine them throughout the year. Any student may bring up an issue they see, and we will discuss it as a class. I will also bring up issues as I see them. Occasionally we will all take a time for a behavior reflection. We will write out how we think the behaviors are working, how well we are following them, and what we need to change or practice. Throughout the year I may take notes on behaviors that I see, so we can talk about them either one-on-one or as a class.
</p>
<h4>Behavior Troubles</h4>
<p>These are guidelines you are setting for yourselves and each other; it is up to you to enforce them. I encourage you to politely remind each other and me about the expectations. However, there are some behaviors that are an immediate physical or emotional safety issue, such as name-calling and fighting. We will also decide on these together, and on appropriate actions for the people involved to take. As I said at the beginning, however, my primary goal is to keep everyone safe, and I will remove students from the class if necessary to do that. We will still have a discussion and make a game-plan afterwards, but I will not be patient with danger.
<h4>Other Routines</h4>
<p>For more details on the sort of expectations that I want to develop, as well as how I will introduce and enforce those expectations, please check out the following notes: < href="Classroom_Routines_and_Procedures.pdf">Classroom Routines and Procedures</a>
