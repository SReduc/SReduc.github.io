<h3>Substitute Plan and Information</h3>
Thank you for taking care of my class while I'm gone! This page should help prepare you for how we usually operate.

<h4 id="subbehaviors>Student Behaviors</h4>
<p>The students have a lot of ownership over our classroom, and it may feel a bit wild at first. However, they should still be kind, get their work done, and listen when you get their attention.<br />
Food: Food and drink are allowed with the exception of anything containing peanuts.<br />
Phones: Students may use phones to listen to music or occasionally text while doing independent work; however, if phones become a distraction from working they must put them away.<br />
Seats: There are no assigned seats. Students may work at a desk or use a clipboard to work anywhere in the room. <br />
Teacher's Desk: There is no specific teacher's desk. You can set up at any of the tables in the room.<br />
Restrooms: Students sign out on the clipboard near the door for using the restroom or taking a break. They can do this at any time, but must let you know that they are stepping out.<br />
General behavior: There are posters on the walls of the room with behaviors that each period has set for themselves. Remind them of these behaviors if necessary. Students know that I am expecting a report from you about issues. If behavior issues continue or if a student seems unable to focus on work, feel free to send them to the office to finish it. This is not getting them in trouble; this is letting them move to a different environment so they can reset. <br />
</p>
<h4 id="subroutines">Routines</h4>
<p>Class ususlly starts with a review. Feel free to ask the students to tell you about what they've learned from the last lesson(s) so that you know where we are. They should be able to answer thoughtful questions and analyze the information.<br />
Students' notebooks are kept on the shelf at the front of the room. They will need these for most assignments in class. They can take pencils and other material from the supply shelf at the back of the room as needed. When they have completed an assignment it should be turned into the basket for their period at the front of the room.<br />
If students are doing any activity that requires crafting or lab work, please stop them about 10 minutes before the end of class to clean up. They are required to make sure that the floor is clean and supplies are put away before they leave. <br />
If you have extra time after clean-up, or in the last 5 minutes of class, feel free to ask them review questions about the day's activity and what they have learned from it.
<p>
<h4id="sublessons">Lesson Plans</h4>
<p>Hopefully I have left a lesson plan for you either at the front desk or on the middle table in the classroom. But if I was called out too suddenly to plan, here are a couple activities you can use with the students:<br />
1. Independent Study.<br />
Each student has a year-long project they are working on. They can use this time to continue doing research or write-ups for their project. The class set of chromebooks is available for use. Students should be taking notes about what they are reading or watching, or else working on assembling their proposal. Feel free to walk around the room and ask them questions. They should be able to explain the details of their project and how what they are looking at ties into it.<br />
2. Evolution Card Game. <br />
On the shelves at the front of the room are a bunch of decks for the evolution game. This plays similar to any collectable card game (Magic, yu-gi-oh, pokemon...). Each player tries to mutate their species to survive natural disasters and other environmental changes. There are specific instructions in the boxes that the students should be able to follow. Have them wrap up their games about 15min before the end of class, and tell them to write a reflection in their lab book comparing/contrasting their game to how real evolution works.
