<h4>Resources for Class Practices and Projects</h4>
<p>Here is an overview of <a href="https://blogs.reed.edu/ed-tech/2016/03/plickers-an-excellent-alternative-to-clickers/">Plickers,</a> which we will use as a way to quickly answer and discuss class quizes.
</p>
<p>Throughout the year we will be doing citizen science projects. Here are some websites to find a project that interests you: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/idea/citizen-science-projects/">National Geographic,</a> <a href="https://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/#">CitizenScience.org, </a> <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects">Zooniverse,</a> and <a href="https://scistarter.org/finder">SciStarter.</a>
</p>
<p>We will also be doing quite a bit of online research. Here are some databases and search engines for easy access:<br />
<a href="scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> works like a basic Google search, but returns academic articles and books. Search results will also show if there is a free pdf of the article on the author's website or in a database.<br />
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">Pubmed</a> is the NIH database of articles on medicine, microbiology, and biotechnology.<br />
The NIH also has a database for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/">Looking up sequenced genomes</a> and a program for <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">comparing gene or protein sequences (BLAST)</a>.<br />
<a href="https://www.ebsco.com/">EBSCO</a> is one of the largest academic databases for both online and print information. Our school has limited access to full-text articles, but this is a good starting place for looking at abstracts and learning jargon.<br />
If you are stuck, here is UNM's <a href="https://libguides.unm.edu/biology303/webresources">Guide to research and scholarly articles</a> and <a href="https://libguides.unm.edu/biology303/readingarticles">Guide to reading original research.</a>
