<p>Welcome! Here's what students and parents need to know for back-to-school</p>
<h3>Schedule (hypothetical)</h3>
<p>Our school uses a block schedule. Students attend all of their classes on Monday, and attend first period each day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays students also go to Periods 2, 4, and 6; on Wednesdays and Fridays they have (1), 3, 5, and 7. This sort of every-other-day schedule lets of have a larger chunk of time to focus on each class. <a href="schedule.html>Click here for the full schedule for this class.</a>
