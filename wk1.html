title: First week of school
---

<p>Welcome! Here's what students and parents need to know for back-to-school</p>
<h3>Schedule (hypothetical)</h3>
<p>Our school uses a block schedule. Students attend all of their classes on Monday, and attend first period each day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays students also go to Periods 2, 4, and 6; on Wednesdays and Fridays they have (1), 3, 5, and 7. This sort of every-other-day schedule lets of have a larger chunk of time to focus on each class. <a href="schedule.html">Click here for the full schedule for this class.</a>
</p>
<p>Our activities in class will vary from day-to-day, but we will move through the activities like this:
<ul>
  <li>Prologue – discuss anything we need to discuss, such as questions and concerns</li>
  <li>Review – plicker quiz + discussion</li>
  <li>Intro – what we are doing today</li>
  <li>Lesson</li>
  <li>Clean-up</li>
  <li>Wrap-up – summary class discussion
  </li></ul></p>

<h3> Supplies </h3>
<p>Students need the following items for our class. I have a limited number of supplies available for students who do not have access to these materials from home</p>
<ul><li>Science notebook: This can be any sort of notebook (composition book, spiral notebook, binder of looseleaf paper, etc). In addition to recording lab experiments, you will use this book to take notes and to write reflections on the class topics. These notebooks will usually be left in class, so don't combine it with a book for another class! I will check them regularly to see how you are thinking about and working with the class topics. At the end of the year, this notebook should contain almost everything you have done for this class.
  </li>
  <li>Pens or pencils</li>
</ul>
<h3> What the first days will look like </h3>
<h4>Getting to know each other</h4>
<p> It is important to me to have a good relationship with my students. Much of this relationship will develop over the course of the year, but to start with we will use some activities to get to know each other.</p>
<p>Attendance: When taking attendance during the first week of school I will move around to your desks and ask each student their name. This will give you a chance to correct my pronunciation and tell me of any nickname or specific pronouns you use. It will alsogive us a chance to chat a bit. Expect me to jump into whatever discussion you are having, and feel free to use this as a chance to ask me any questions you have.
  </p>
<p>Student Info Sheet: On the first day students will fill out an information sheet with info such as allergies I should know about, preferred language for you and for your family, and your interests (in biology-related subjects and anything else you want to tell me). I will use this information to tailor our lessons to the class's interests, to make sure none of our labs will set off allergies, ant to aid communication.
  </p>
<p>1-1 Check-ins: I will check in with students during the first week of school and repeatedly throughout the year. As time allows during independent work, I will talk to students one-on-one about how they are doing, in general and with the class; if they are having issues or if there is something I can do to help them. Much of the time this may just be general conversation, but this is also a chance for us to work together to get you through the class around whatever else is going on in your life.
