<p>Welcome!<br />
This is the home page for my biology classes. This is an exploratory class in which you will design your own projects and have the chance to discover and answer your own questions.<br />
* Please note that this site was put together as part of a class for teachers. I am not in my own classroom, and so much of the information here is hypothetical or idealized.
